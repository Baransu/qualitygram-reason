# qualitygram-re

Qualitygram (codeheroes-recruitment-app) written in Reason.

My problems with Reason before any serious usage in production code. Divided in three levels of complexity how to solve them.

### Easy:

* Some problems with Promises and Fetch API. It can be a lot better not only in terms of better code (or batter naming), but also in terms of better documentation. Not clear and no examples how to handle errors properly.
* Not polished Promise API. `then_` works differently than in JS while we're expecting it to work the same. (https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/issues/1739, https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/pull/2046)

### Medium:

### Hard:
